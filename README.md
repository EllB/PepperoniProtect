PepperoniProtect
===========
Introduction
--------------
PepperoniProtect is a simple prtection plugin for your Bukkit Minecraft server designed to fit both admins wanting to protect server stuff - such as the spawn area - and players wanting to protect their own local area - such as their house. In the source you will find all my unorganized and weird-looking classes with some comments put on weird places, as well as license texts and more!

License
---------
The plugin is a part of "The SpicyPack" which is a package of plugins with spicy names (such as PepperoniProtect and ChiliChat). All plugins in the spicy pack is licensed under my home-made license called the SpicyCode license, smart, isn't it? ;-)

Contributing
---------------
Yes - you may of course contribute with your own code, just leave a pull request and I may add it. It would be **more than great!**

Thanks to
